  <h1>Valentines Day Card to my best friend, Summer</h1>
  <h2>Things I like about you</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I like how you helped me in freshman year and I probably wouldn't have passed engineering without you</li>
    <li>I like how you have remained my most loyal friend throughout highschool</li>
    <li>I like how you have a really, really cute cat</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Poem for you that I didn't write</h2>
  <p>"Since You're My friend</p>
  <p>Valentines can be a special day</p>
  <p>When Someone really cares about you</p>
  <p>This valentine's day is more than o.k</p>
  <p>Since you're my friend and I'm yours too"</p>
